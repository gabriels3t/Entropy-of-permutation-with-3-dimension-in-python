# Entropy-of-permutation-with-3-dimension-in-python


Permutation Entropy (PE) is a robust time series tool which provides a
quantification measure of the complexity of a dynamic system by
capturing the order relations between values of a time series and
extracting a probability distribution of the ordinal patterns

This program is for 3 dimension, according to studies the dimensions need to be between 3 and 7, but with 3 dimensions we have satisfactory results.
